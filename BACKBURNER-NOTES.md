# BACKBURNER NOTES

**Purpose:** Track low-priority/blocked items that don't need active Todoist tasks.

## 📋 Items on Hold

### 1. Package Tracking Integration
- **Status:** ⏸️ Blocked (needs carrier API access)
- **Notes:** Would integrate with Telegram for delivery updates
- **Priority:** Low - manual tracking works fine for now

### 2. Ultrahuman Integration  
- **Status:** ⏸️ Blocked (needs Ultrahuman API access)
- **Notes:** Health/fitness data sync would be nice but not critical
- **Priority:** Low - manual tracking acceptable

### 3. Calendar Integration
- **Status:** ⏸️ Blocked (needs calendar API setup)
- **Notes:** Would enable event reminders and scheduling
- **Priority:** Medium - useful but not urgent

## 🔄 Review Process
- Check during quarterly reviews
- Move to Todoist if becomes unblocked/higher priority
- Delete if no longer relevant after 6 months
