## Cron Optimization - Option C Implementation (02:05 UTC / 9:05 PM EST Jan 29)

**Context:** Yesterday's docs deep-dive revealed I was using cron/heartbeat wrong. Discussed three approaches with Shirin.

**Decision:** Option C (Hybrid) - batch flexible checks in heartbeat, keep scheduled deliverables as cron.

**Changes made:**
1. **Removed cron jobs (3 total):**
   - `gmail-scan` (1 AM) - Removed entirely per Shirin's request
   - `daily-security-report` (10 AM) - Moved to heartbeat (flexible timing)
   - `system-cleanup-logging` (2:30 AM) - Moved to heartbeat (flexible timing)

2. **Added cron job:**
   - `improvement-analysis` (4:30 AM EST) - Generates daily improvement proposals before morning brief

3. **Rewrote HEARTBEAT.md:**
   - Clear "when to act vs stay silent" section
   - Specific triggers for each check (no vague "every 3-4 hours")
   - Security monitoring: Check logs, alert if >50 SSH failures or unusual activity
   - System maintenance: Check disk/memory, auto-cleanup when safe
   - Overnight autonomous work: 1-5 AM window, pick task, work 30-90 min
   - Memory review: Use CLI tools, merge fragments
   - Self-review: Document mistakes, track failure modes

4. **Updated CRON.json** to reflect current state (13 jobs remaining)

**Result:**
- 3 fewer cron jobs (16 → 13)
- More flexible security/system checks (runs when heartbeat polls vs fixed time)
- Clearer heartbeat logic (no more "every 3-4 hours" ambiguity)
- Improvement analysis now feeds morning brief automatically

**Git commit:** d87229c

**Token savings:** ~2-3 API calls/day (batching security + system checks in one heartbeat turn)

**Next in fixing things I was doing wrong:**
- [ ] Memory search discipline
- [ ] Memory writing automation  
- [ ] Model fallback config (when API keys ready)
- [ ] Session freshness (suggest /new more)
