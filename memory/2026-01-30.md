## Heartbeat Dispatcher Shipped
- Agreed and shipped heartbeat-driven dispatcher (no cron, no events).
- Dispatcher logic: on each heartbeat, scan Todoist; ignore Done/In progress/Blocked; if now >= due time then act.
- Act on ALL eligible tasks.
- Status is comment-based: Needs clarity, Ready, In progress, Blocked, Done.
- Atlas triages first; may ask Shirin for clarity before assigning.
- Manual flow validated end-to-end.
- Live heartbeat check at 7:12 PM correctly ignored task due at 7:15 PM.
- Demo task created and verified behavior.
