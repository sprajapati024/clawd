## Project Workspace Pattern Implemented (11:21 PM EST)

**Created:** `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/` workspace following Pokey's optimal pattern

**Files:**
- `BUSINESS.md` - Project overview, goals, context (fake day trader simulation)
- `WORKFLOWS.md` - Daily/weekly routines, trading workflows, alert system
- `TOOLS.md` - API setup, Python environment, Clawdbot integration

**Pattern benefits:**
1. **Context isolation** - Project knowledge stays in project folder
2. **Mobile workflow** - Shirin stays in main Telegram chat, Clarke spawns project agents
3. **Scalable** - New project = new folder with same template
4. **Clean separation** - No mixing personal/business context

**How it works:**
- Shirin asks Clarke about project
- Clarke spawns sub-agent with `workspace=/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/`
- Sub-agent reads project files, does work
- Sub-agent reports back to Clarke
- Clarke summarizes for Shirin

**Tested:** Spawned day-trader-test agent to validate workflow

**Committed to git:** Pushed project structure to remote repo

**Next:** Can expand to smart-home, portfolio-redesign, other projects using same pattern
