## Project Workspace Pattern Implemented (11:21 PM EST)

**Created:** `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/` workspace following Pokey's optimal pattern

**Files:**
- `BUSINESS.md` - Project overview, goals, context (fake day trader simulation)
- `WORKFLOWS.md` - Daily/weekly routines, trading workflows, alert system
- `TOOLS.md` - API setup, Python environment, Clawdbot integration

**Pattern benefits:**
1. **Context isolation** - Project knowledge stays in project folder
2. **Mobile workflow** - Shirin stays in main Telegram chat, Clarke spawns project agents
3. **Scalable** - New project = new folder with same template
4. **Clean separation** - No mixing personal/business context

**How it works:**
- Shirin asks Clarke about project
- Clarke spawns sub-agent with `workspace=/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/`
- Sub-agent reads project files, does work
- Sub-agent reports back to Clarke
- Clarke summarizes for Shirin

**Tested:** Spawned day-trader-test agent to validate workflow

**Committed to git:** Pushed project structure to remote repo

**Next:** Can expand to smart-home, portfolio-redesign, other projects using same pattern

## Morning Brief Wake Mode Fixed (6:02 AM EST)

**Issue:** Morning brief cron ran at 5 AM but didn't deliver - was waiting for heartbeat
**Fix:** Changed `wakeMode` from `"next-heartbeat"` → `"now"`
**Result:** Tomorrow's brief will deliver immediately at 5 AM

## Skill Cleanup - Removed macOS/iOS Dependencies (6:05 AM EST)

**Mistake:** Overnight skill installation included 9 macOS/iOS-only skills
**Problem:** Running on Linux VPS, these skills won't work without Mac Mini
**Shirin called it out:** "Why did you install if you know you live in VPS?"

**Removed skills:**
- apple-contacts, apple-mail-search, apple-music, apple-photos, apple-remind-me
- icloud-findmy, things-mac, healthkit-sync, shortcuts-skill

**Kept (VPS-compatible):**
- dexter (stock research)
- todoist (tasks)
- google-workspace-mcp, gog (Google)
- vercel (deploy)
- track17, youtube-summarizer, steam (utilities)

**Lesson:** Filter installation lists based on environment before executing
**Updated:** TOOLS.md now shows VPS-compatible skills only
**Committed:** Changes pushed to git with acknowledgment of mistake
