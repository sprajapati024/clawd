## Heartbeat v2 Shipped
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with optimized structure.
- Cadence changed to **every 45 minutes**.
- Added **Todoist Dispatcher** section (due‑time execution engine).
- Dispatcher logic: scan assigned tasks; ignore Done/In progress/Blocked; if now >= due time then act.
- Act on ALL eligible tasks.
- Status‑by‑comment contract remains.
- Inline reporting: dispatcher actions appear inside heartbeat report.
- Removed noise: detailed task lists, commit‑by‑commit git reporting, overnight autonomous work.
- System & security now exception‑only reporting.
- Team status now CEO‑level oversight (blockers/decisions only).
- Memory discipline remains but silent unless slipping.
- Self‑review mandatory (internal only).
- Live heartbeat validation at 7:12 PM correctly ignored task due at 7:15 PM.
- Demo task created and verified behavior.
- Gmail scanner task added (due 9:00 PM, Status: Needs clarity).
