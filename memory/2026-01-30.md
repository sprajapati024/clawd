## Heartbeat v2 Shipped
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with optimized structure.
- Cadence changed to **every 45 minutes**.
- Added **Todoist Dispatcher** section (due‑time execution engine).
- Dispatcher logic: scan assigned tasks; ignore Done/In progress/Blocked; if now >= due time then act.
- Act on ALL eligible tasks.
- Status‑by‑comment contract remains.
- Inline reporting: dispatcher actions appear inside heartbeat report.
- Removed noise: detailed task lists, commit‑by‑commit git reporting, overnight autonomous work.
- System & security now exception‑only reporting.
- Team status now CEO‑level oversight (blockers/decisions only).
- Memory discipline remains but silent unless slipping.
- Self‑review mandatory (internal only).
- Live heartbeat validation at 7:12 PM correctly ignored task due at 7:15 PM.
- Demo task created and verified behavior.
- Gmail scanner task added (due 9:00 PM, Status: Needs clarity).
- **Heartbeat now runs 24/7** (removed late‑night exception; runs continuously).

## Dispatcher Bug Fixed
- Identified gap: dispatcher was **reporting** actions instead of **taking** actions.
- Fixed: dispatcher now **asks questions** and **nudges owners** immediately, not just reports.
- Gmail scanner scope clarified: read-only already implemented (day one), scan for events/bills/important notifications, deliver via Telegram or weave into conversation naturally.
- Task moved to Strategic, assigned to Forge, marked Ready.

## Gmail Scanner Built (Forge)
- Built `/root/clawd/scripts/gmail-important-scanner.py`
- Scans Gmail for: events, bills, important notifications
- Uses existing Gmail read-only authentication
- Detects keywords and sender patterns
- Formats results for Telegram delivery
- Test run successful: detected 22 important items (4 events, 13 bills, 5 important)
- Examples caught: Cineplex movie confirmation, OpenAI API funding, Hetzner code, Kits.ca order
- Task marked Done
