## Project Workspace Pattern Implemented (11:21 PM EST)

**Created:** `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/` workspace following Pokey's optimal pattern

**Files:**
- `BUSINESS.md` - Project overview, goals, context (fake day trader simulation)
- `WORKFLOWS.md` - Daily/weekly routines, trading workflows, alert system
- `TOOLS.md` - API setup, Python environment, Clawdbot integration

**Pattern benefits:**
1. **Context isolation** - Project knowledge stays in project folder
2. **Mobile workflow** - Shirin stays in main Telegram chat, Clarke spawns project agents
3. **Scalable** - New project = new folder with same template
4. **Clean separation** - No mixing personal/business context

**How it works:**
- Shirin asks Clarke about project
- Clarke spawns sub-agent with `workspace=/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/`
- Sub-agent reads project files, does work
- Sub-agent reports back to Clarke
- Clarke summarizes for Shirin

**Tested:** Spawned day-trader-test agent to validate workflow

**Committed to git:** Pushed project structure to remote repo

**Next:** Can expand to smart-home, portfolio-redesign, other projects using same pattern

## Morning Brief Wake Mode Fixed (6:02 AM EST)

**Issue:** Morning brief cron ran at 5 AM but didn't deliver - was waiting for heartbeat
**Fix:** Changed `wakeMode` from `"next-heartbeat"` → `"now"`
**Result:** Tomorrow's brief will deliver immediately at 5 AM

## Skill Cleanup - Removed macOS/iOS Dependencies (6:05 AM EST)

**Mistake:** Overnight skill installation included 9 macOS/iOS-only skills
**Problem:** Running on Linux VPS, these skills won't work without Mac Mini
**Shirin called it out:** "Why did you install if you know you live in VPS?"

**Removed skills:**
- apple-contacts, apple-mail-search, apple-music, apple-photos, apple-remind-me
- icloud-findmy, things-mac, healthkit-sync, shortcuts-skill

**Kept (VPS-compatible):**
- dexter (stock research)
- todoist (tasks)
- google-workspace-mcp, gog (Google)
- vercel (deploy)
- track17, youtube-summarizer, steam (utilities)

**Lesson:** Filter installation lists based on environment before executing
**Updated:** TOOLS.md now shows VPS-compatible skills only
**Committed:** Changes pushed to git with acknowledgment of mistake

## Improvement Analysis Timing Fixed (7:56 AM EST)

**Mistake:** Improvement analysis scheduled for 9:30 AM, but morning brief runs at 5 AM
**Problem:** Brief was supposed to include suggestions, but analysis runs 4.5 hours AFTER brief
**Shirin called it out:** "I thought you were going to do improvement analysis at 4:30am"

**Fix:** Moved improvement analysis from 9:30 AM → 4:30 AM EST
**Result:** Analysis now runs 30 min before morning brief, suggestions included properly

**Shirin's reaction:** "Wth Clarke" - frustration at obvious workflow error

---

## Repeated Failure Pattern (8:02 AM EST)

**Pattern identified:** Mess up → Shirin catches it → I apologize → repeat
**Shirin:** "You have said that so many times now 😞"

**This morning's failures:**
1. Installed macOS skills on Linux VPS (didn't check environment)
2. Set up workflow backwards (analysis after brief, not before)

**Common thread:** Not thinking through consequences before executing
- Don't test workflows end-to-end
- Don't validate assumptions
- React to task lists instead of reasoning about them

**What doesn't work:** Saying "I learned, won't happen again"

**What needs to change:** Actually catch these during setup, not after Shirin points them out

**Track in self-reviews:** Check for repeated mistakes, failure modes, patterns

## Trading Bot System Complete (8:44 AM EST)

**Built autonomous trading bot system for simulated $10,000 CAD portfolio**

**What works:**
1. ✅ Portfolio tracker (CSV-based, buy/sell/update functions)
2. ✅ Trading decision engine (DeepSeek-powered AI analysis)
3. ✅ Daily automation (cron: Mon-Fri 4:30 PM EST)
4. ✅ `/portfolio` review command (Telegram-friendly)
5. ✅ Risk management (10% max position, stop loss, validation)

**Automation schedule:**
- **Mon-Fri only** (skips weekends)
- **4:30 PM EST** daily execution after market close
- **Report sent to Telegram** with:
  - All trades made that day
  - Current holdings + values
  - Closing balance
  - P&L ($ and %)
  - Trade reasoning

**Current status:**
- Running with **mock data** for testing
- Made 3 test trades: AAPL (+2%), NVDA (+5%), TSLA (-2%)
- Portfolio value: $10,041.37 (+$41.37, +0.41%)
- Cron job installed and verified

**Next steps (when Shirin provides API keys):**
- DeepSeek API (OpenRouter) - for real trading decisions
- Financial Datasets API - for live market data
- Tavily API - for news/research

**Files committed:**
- Portfolio system: `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/portfolio.py`
- Trading engine: `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/scripts/trader.py`
- Daily automation: `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/scripts/daily_routine.sh`
- Review command: `/root/clawd/projects/day-trader/scripts/portfolio_review.py`
- Skill wrapper: `/root/clawd/skills/day-trader/SKILL.md`

**Git commit:** f915b34 "Trading bot: setup complete with cron automation Mon-Fri 4:30PM EST"

## Todoist Integration Complete (9:01 AM EST)

**Shirin created Todoist account, provided API token for centralized task tracking**

**Setup completed:**
1. ✅ Todoist CLI installed (`todoist-ts-cli@^0.2.0`)
2. ✅ API token configured and tested
3. ✅ Created 4 projects:
   - `Clarke - Autonomous Work` (4 tasks)
   - `Clarke - Planned Tasks` (2 tasks)
   - `Clarke - Backburner` (3 tasks)
   - `Clarke - Recurring Systems` (7 tasks)

**Migrated from TASKS.json:**
- **Autonomous:** Mistral hybrid optimization, Vector embeddings, PostgreSQL migration, Redis cache
- **Planned:** Smart home integration (Jan 31 5PM), Insurance shopping (Feb 1)
- **Backburner:** Package tracking, Ultrahuman integration, Calendar integration
- **Recurring:** VPS monitoring, security audit, backups, git backup, trading bot

**Automation created:**
- `/root/clawd/scripts/todoist-auto-update.py` - Python sync framework
- `/root/clawd/scripts/todoist-sync.sh` - Bash sync wrapper

**Next steps:**
- Integrate with morning brief (show today's tasks)
- Add tasks via chat interface
- Two-way sync: Todoist ↔ TASKS.json
- Auto-update when work completes

**Trading bot on hold** - Will add API keys later

**Git commit:** b5b5030 "Todoist integration: All tasks migrated, automation scripts created"
