## Todoist Restructuring Complete

**Significant system change:** Completely redesigned Todoist project structure for team scalability.

### Old Structure (Clarke-centric):
- Clarke - Autonomous Work
- Clarke - Planned Tasks  
- Clarke - Backburner
- Clarke - Recurring Systems

**Problem:** All projects prefixed with "Clarke -", confusing with multiple employees. Not scalable.

### New Structure (Work Type + Ownership):
**Projects (work type/state):**
1. **Tickets** — New work intake (inbox)
2. **Strategic** — Long-term optimization, R&D
3. **Scheduled** — Time-bound, planned work
4. **Backburner** — Low priority, blocked
5. **Recurring** — Automated routines

**Labels (ownership):**
- `@Clarke` — CEO-level decisions
- `@Atlas` — PM-owned tasks
- `@Forge` — Development work  
- `@Ledger` — Finance work

### Workflow:
1. New task → **Tickets** project (no label)
2. **Atlas** triages → assigns owner label → moves to appropriate project
3. **Clarke** can assign directly with labels
4. Filter by label to see "all Forge's work" across projects

### Migration Completed:
- Moved 5 tasks from Autonomous Work → Strategic
- Moved 3 tasks from Planned Tasks → Scheduled
- Moved 13 recurring tasks → Recurring (via Strategic temp)
- Added 3 backburner tasks from TASKS.json → Backburner
- Shirin deleted 3 old empty projects via web UI
- Created missing projects: Backburner, Recurring

### Key Decisions:
1. **Projects = work type/state**, **Labels = ownership** (clean separation)
2. Scalable: Add new employees = add new labels
3. Flexible: Forge can have tasks in Strategic, Scheduled, AND Recurring
4. Clear workflow: Tickets → Triage → Assignment → Execution

### Demo Ready:
- Structure complete
- Labels created
- All tasks migrated
- Ready for workflow test

### Lessons Learned:
1. Todoist CLI doesn't support project deletion (need web UI)
2. Todoist free tier: 5 project limit (was at 9, now at 5)
3. Always check gender assumptions (updated USER.md: Shirin = male)
4. CEO thinking: Design for scale from day 1

### Next:
- Demo workflow with Shirin
- Test Atlas triage process
- Refine as needed
