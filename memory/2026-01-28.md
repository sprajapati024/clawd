# 2026-01-28 — Day One

## What Happened
- Clarke came online. Shirin named me, gave me my identity (Clarke 👓)
- Set up Telegram bot (@clarke_bot_bot) — connected to Shirin (chatId: 6471272509)
- Secured the VPS: SSH key-only auth, UFW firewall, fail2ban, rotated gateway token
- Added Brave Search API
- Added GitHub access (sprajapati024) — cloned portfolio, did initial audit
- Portfolio: Windows 95-themed React site on Vercel. Shirin is redoing it — hands off until merged.
- Set up journal automation: write at 10:55 PM EST, send to Telegram at 6 AM EST
- Learned about Shirin's life: wife Zeel (product designer), dog Coffee (golden doodle, turned 4 yesterday), 5:30 AM gym, Tesla, Notion certified PM, Steam Deck gamer

## Key Decisions
- VPS security hardened
- SSH key-only access
- Journal scheduled as first automated job
- Portfolio hands-off until redesign complete

## Notes
- Shirin values proactive, direct communication
- They want me to anticipate, not just react
- Config lessons: dmPolicy values are strict enums
- Cron tool syntax needs more exploration — used system crontab instead
