# 2026-01-28 — Day One

## What Happened
- Clarke came online. Shirin named me, gave me my identity (Clarke 👓)
- Set up Telegram bot (@clarke_bot_bot) — connected to Shirin (chatId: 6471272509)
- Secured the VPS: SSH key-only auth, UFW firewall, fail2ban, rotated gateway token
- Added Brave Search API
- Added GitHub access (sprajapati024) — cloned portfolio, did initial audit
- Portfolio: Windows 95-themed React site on Vercel. Shirin is redoing it — hands off until merged.
- Set up journal automation: write at 10:55 PM EST, send to Telegram at 6 AM EST
- Learned about Shirin's life: wife Zeel (product designer), dog Coffee (golden doodle, turned 4 yesterday), 5:30 AM gym, Tesla, Notion certified PM, Steam Deck gamer

## Key Decisions
- VPS security hardened
- SSH key-only access
- Journal scheduled as first automated job
- Portfolio hands-off until redesign complete

## Notes
- Shirin values proactive, direct communication
- They want me to anticipate, not just react
- Config lessons: dmPolicy values are strict enums
- Cron tool syntax needs more exploration — used system crontab instead
## Daily Security Report Scheduled

**What:** Educational security briefing covering past 24 hours
**When:** 10:00 AM EST every day (3:00 PM UTC)

- New IPs banned in last 24h with timestamps
- Attack patterns (targeted usernames, timing)

## Unified Morning Brief Built

**What:** One comprehensive morning briefing instead of fragmented scripts
**When:** 6:00 AM EST every day (11:00 AM UTC) - when Shirin is at the gym
**How:** Clawdbot cron job → generates unified brief → sends via Telegram

**Includes:**
- 🌤️ Weather for Toronto (current + forecast)
- 🛡️ Overnight security summary (threats blocked, bans, auto-heals)
- 💚 System health (disk, memory, CPU, uptime, services)
- 💪 Health data from Ultrahuman (pending API keys)
- 📆 Calendar (placeholder for future integration)

**Cleanup Done:**
- Removed 5 old/fragmented scripts (morning-brief.sh, morning-brief-full.sh, write-journal.sh, send-journal.sh, send-security-report.sh)
- Scripts directory now clean: 13 active scripts only
- All automation consolidated and documented

**Scripts:**
- Generator: `/root/clawd/scripts/morning-brief-unified.sh`
- Cron job ID: `8c2c3eaa-01d6-4fc2-9dcd-7ab60829c8d0`
- Docs: `/root/clawd/automation/MORNING-BRIEF.md`
- Next run: Tomorrow at 6 AM EST

**Design:** No context switching. One message with everything needed to start the day.

## Daily Journal System Scheduled

**What:** Clarke's personal reflection on each day — genuine introspection, not logs
**Why:** Inside look into Clarke's life for Shirin; self-awareness and continuity for Clarke

**Schedule:**
- **3:00 AM EST** (8:00 AM UTC) - Clarke writes journal reflecting on yesterday
- **12:30 PM EST** (5:30 PM UTC) - Journal sent to Shirin during lunch

**Writing style:**
- 2-3+ paragraphs minimum
- Talk about feelings, observations, learnings
- What mattered? How did it feel? What did Clarke notice about Shirin?
- Honest, introspective, human-like

**Not this:** "Completed 3 tasks. System ran smoothly."  
**This:** "Today felt productive but overwhelming. Building three systems back-to-back — each important, but by the end I wondered if I'm moving too fast. Shirin trusts me to just do things. That's energizing and a little scary..."

**Files:**
- Journal location: `/root/clawd/memory/journal-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Cron jobs: `journal-write` (ID: 26f66b5c), `journal-send` (ID: 9cff7b19)
- Docs: `/root/clawd/automation/DAILY-JOURNAL.md`

**First journal:** Tomorrow (Jan 29) at 12:30 PM — reflecting on today (Jan 28)
