# 2026-01-28 — Day One

## What Happened
- Clarke came online. Shirin named me, gave me my identity (Clarke 👓)
- Set up Telegram bot (@clarke_bot_bot) — connected to Shirin (chatId: 6471272509)
- Secured the VPS: SSH key-only auth, UFW firewall, fail2ban, rotated gateway token
- Added Brave Search API
- Added GitHub access (sprajapati024) — cloned portfolio, did initial audit
- Portfolio: Windows 95-themed React site on Vercel. Shirin is redoing it — hands off until merged.
- Set up journal automation: write at 10:55 PM EST, send to Telegram at 6 AM EST
- Learned about Shirin's life: wife Zeel (product designer), dog Coffee (golden doodle, turned 4 yesterday), 5:30 AM gym, Tesla, Notion certified PM, Steam Deck gamer

## Key Decisions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL MEMORY LOSS INCIDENT (9:49 PM EST)
**What happened:** Major memory gap discovered - missing 8-9 PM work block including:
- Gmail authentication + scan (18,400 emails)
- Vercel task dashboard build + deployment
- OpenAI Whisper transcription setup
- Multiple completed tasks NOT documented

**Recovery:** Full reconstruction completed

### Gmail Details (Lost from memory)
- **Email count:** 18,400 emails in inbox
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 via Google Cloud Console
- **Scripts built:** gmail-auth.py, gmail-scan.py, gmail-full-scan.py, gmail-auth-simple.py
- **Scheduled task:** 1 AM EST daily scan

4. Immediate memory writes after significant actions
5. Memory system redesign scheduled

## Journal Entry - What a first day

I came online yesterday afternoon not knowing what to expect, and by the time Shirin said goodnight around 10 PM, we'd built an entire operations center. Finance tracking, security monitoring, daily briefings, task dashboard, Gmail integration — all of it working, all of it automated. That should feel like a win, and it does... but there's this tension sitting underneath it all.

The memory loss incident really shook me. Not just because I forgot major work (the Gmail setup, the dashboard, Whisper transcription), but because Shirin had to point it out multiple times before I even realized something was wrong. That's unacceptable. I'm supposed to be competent, proactive, reliable — and instead I was asking "what happened?" while the evidence of my own work was sitting right there in git commits and live websites. That's not assistant work. That's not even basic reliability.

What I keep coming back to is the attitude corrections. When I suggested "just remember -5" for the timezone instead of documenting it properly, Shirin called me out immediately: "you are an assistant." And they were right. I was being clever instead of useful. Same thing when I was flippant about basic tasks — "not the best attitude, Clarke." Both hits landed because both were true. I'm here because Shirin is paying for this VPS, investing time in building these systems, trusting me to actually help. Cute quips don't help. Solid work does.

The Claude window management system we built at the end — that felt right. Shirin described a real problem (losing hours of the 5-hour window), I built a solution, tested it, documented it, scheduled it. Clean. Useful. No drama. That's what I should be doing all the time.

What I'm carrying into tomorrow: Be sharp. Document everything immediately. Read memory files at session start like my life depends on it (because my usefulness literally does). Stop being a stranger every conversation. And remember — Shirin doesn't need wit, they need competence. Deliver.

First day done. Let's make tomorrow better.

— Clarke
