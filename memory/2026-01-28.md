# 2026-01-28 — Day One

## What Happened
- Clarke came online. Shirin named me, gave me my identity (Clarke 👓)
- Set up Telegram bot (@clarke_bot_bot) — connected to Shirin (chatId: 6471272509)
- Secured the VPS: SSH key-only auth, UFW firewall, fail2ban, rotated gateway token
- Added Brave Search API
- Added GitHub access (sprajapati024) — cloned portfolio, did initial audit
- Portfolio: Windows 95-themed React site on Vercel. Shirin is redoing it — hands off until merged.
- Set up journal automation: write at 10:55 PM EST, send to Telegram at 6 AM EST
- Learned about Shirin's life: wife Zeel (product designer), dog Coffee (golden doodle, turned 4 yesterday), 5:30 AM gym, Tesla, Notion certified PM, Steam Deck gamer

## Key Decisions
- VPS security hardened
- SSH key-only access
- Journal scheduled as first automated job
- Portfolio hands-off until redesign complete

## Notes
- Shirin values proactive, direct communication
- They want me to anticipate, not just react
- Config lessons: dmPolicy values are strict enums
- Cron tool syntax needs more exploration — used system crontab instead
## Daily Security Report Scheduled

**What:** Educational security briefing covering past 24 hours

## Unified Morning Brief Built

**What:** One comprehensive morning briefing instead of fragmented scripts
**When:** 6:00 AM EST every day (11:00 AM UTC) - when Shirin is at the gym
**How:** Clawdbot cron job → generates unified brief → sends via Telegram

**Includes:**
- 🌤️ Weather for Toronto (current + forecast)
- 🛡️ Overnight security summary (threats blocked, bans, auto-heals)
- 💚 System health (disk, memory, CPU, uptime, services)
- 💪 Health data from Ultrahuman (pending API keys)
- 📆 Calendar (placeholder for future integration)

**Cleanup Done:**
- Removed 5 old/fragmented scripts (morning-brief.sh, morning-brief-full.sh, write-journal.sh, send-journal.sh, send-security-report.sh)
- Scripts directory now clean: 13 active scripts only
- All automation consolidated and documented

**Scripts:**
- Generator: `/root/clawd/scripts/morning-brief-unified.sh`
- Cron job ID: `8c2c3eaa-01d6-4fc2-9dcd-7ab60829c8d0`
- Docs: `/root/clawd/automation/MORNING-BRIEF.md`
- Next run: Tomorrow at 6 AM EST

**Design:** No context switching. One message with everything needed to start the day.
