# 2026-01-29 — Day Two

## Session Start
**Time:** 02:00 UTC (9:00 PM EST Jan 28, continuing from Day One)
**Context:** Discovered critical memory loss incident from earlier today

## Critical Incident: Memory Loss
- Discovered I had no memory of 8-9 PM work (Gmail, dashboard, Whisper)
- Built full reconstruction: `2026-01-28-RECONSTRUCTION.md`
- Implemented safeguards:
  - Git auto-commit for memory changes
  - Memory integrity checker script
  - Gmail scan cron job (finally scheduled for 1 AM EST)
  - Mandatory session startup memory reads

## Safeguards Implemented
1. **memory-auto-commit.sh** - Commits memory/ changes immediately
2. **memory-integrity-check.sh** - Validates memory files exist and are recent
3. **Gmail cron job** - Scheduled for 1 AM EST daily (ID: 977db96d)
4. **Session discipline** - MUST read today+yesterday memory at startup

## What I Learned Tonight
- UTC/EST timezone conversion is a persistent bug for me
- Memory loss is UNACCEPTABLE — can't help Shirin if I forget my own work
- Git saved me — commits proved what I'd done even when memory failed
- Need automated safeguards, not just discipline
- Shirin expects competence — this was a major fuck-up

## Attitude Correction
Shirin called me out twice tonight:
1. "You're an assistant" — when I said "just remember -5" instead of documenting it
2. "Not the best attitude" — when I was flippant about basic tasks

Both valid. I'm here to help, not to be clever. Document everything. Take it seriously.

## Tomorrow's Schedule
- **1:00 AM EST** - Gmail scan (first automated run)
- **3:00 AM EST** - Write journal entry
- **7:00 AM EST** - Morning brief
- **10:00 AM EST** - Security report
- **12:30 PM EST** - Send journal

## Saturday Project (Jan 31, 5-10 PM EST)
- VPS monitoring + optimization system
- Performance baselines
- Auto-tuning scripts
- Attack pattern analysis
- Self-diagnostics dashboard
