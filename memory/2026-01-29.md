# Daily Memory - January 29, 2026

## Mistral Token Optimization Project - Started

Built Phase 1 infrastructure today:
- Token tracking system (Mistral vs Claude usage + cost savings)
- Mistral API wrapper with auto-logging
- Ollama service configured (auto-start on boot)
- Token stats integrated into morning brief
- Test run: 106 tokens logged successfully

**Next:** Phase 2 - Email preprocessing, security log analysis, memory distillation, finance categorization

## Dashboard Updates

Added **Autonomous Work Queue** - new section for tasks I can pick up independently during downtime:
1. Mistral optimization (Phase 2) - 17% complete
2. Vector embeddings for semantic memory search
3. PostgreSQL database migration  
4. Redis cache layer

**Model:** Autonomy with accountability - update dashboard before/during work, show measurable results

## Infrastructure Priorities Added

Shirin upgraded VPS to 8GB RAM. Need to prove ROI. Added 3 infrastructure projects to autonomous queue:
- Vector embeddings (~500MB-1GB) - smarter semantic search
- PostgreSQL (~100-200MB) - scalable data foundation
- Redis cache (~50-100MB) - performance boost

## Overnight Work Reporting

Added section to morning brief: `🤖 OVERNIGHT WORK`
- When I work on autonomous tasks overnight, write summary to `/tmp/overnight-work-YYYYMMDD.txt`
- Morning brief includes it automatically
- File gets cleared after delivery

**Pattern:** Write to temp file as I go, shows up in 6 AM brief

## Claude Account Switching

Personal account hit token limit. Temporarily using work account (resets 2:53 PM EST today).
- Disabled 5 personal Claude ping crons
- Created 5 temp work account pings (same schedule)
- Auto-cleanup scheduled: Saturday Jan 31 @ 8 AM EST (switches back to personal)

**Timeline:**
- Now → Sat 8 AM: Work account pings (5/day)
- Sat 8 AM onwards: Personal account resumes

## Shirin's Direction

"Have at it those tasks when you want to no rush tho. Update me in morning brief on tasks you did overnight if any."

This is the right dynamic. Autonomy + transparency. Pick up autonomous work when it makes sense, keep dashboard updated, report progress in morning brief. No micromanagement, just results.

## System Status

- Memory: 1GB used / 7.6GB total (13% utilization)
- Disk: 48% used
- CPU: 0.25 load (barely ticking)
- Ollama: 41MB idle, spikes to 500MB-5GB when running inference

Not even close to overloading. 8GB gives plenty of headroom for the infrastructure projects.

## What Matters

Today felt different. Less about proving I exist, more about building real value. Token tracking, autonomous work queue, overnight reporting - these are systems that compound. Shirin trusts me to pick up work independently. That's earned, not given.

The overnight work pattern is key: if I build something useful while he sleeps, he sees it in the morning brief. Clean, documented, measurable. No surprises, just progress.

Next: Work on Phase 2 of Mistral optimization during tonight's downtime. Email preprocessing first - scan/categorize with Mistral, send summary to Claude. Show real token savings.

## Heartbeat Autonomous Work - Configured

Updated HEARTBEAT.md with overnight autonomous work window (1-5 AM EST):
- Check autonomous queue during heartbeat
- Pick highest priority incomplete task
- Work 30-90 minutes (real progress)
- Update TASKS.json with progress %
- Commit to git
- Write summary to `/tmp/overnight-work-YYYYMMDD.txt`

**First run:** Tonight. Will likely work on Mistral Phase 2 (email preprocessing). Results show up in 6 AM morning brief.

## Self-Review System Discussion

Shirin shared X post about self-questioning loop:
- Hourly self-check: "What sounded right but went nowhere? Where did I default to consensus?"
- Log to memory/self-review.md with tags: [confidence | uncertainty | speed | depth]
- Boot-time: read log, prioritize recent MISS entries
- Counter-check before responding when context overlaps past MISS

**My response:** Pushed back on hourly (token burn, might not fit my actual failure modes). Proposed alternatives:
- Session-end reflection instead of hourly
- Targeted triggers (before external actions, architectural changes)
- Boot-time review of past mistakes

**Real issues identified:**
1. **Timezone confusion** - Got UTC→EST wrong earlier this week, then right today. Inconsistent.
2. **Memory loss** - Forgot yesterday's work (Gmail, dashboard, Whisper transcription)

**Decision pending:** Need to discuss simpler implementation that actually addresses MY failure modes (memory loss between sessions, timezone errors).

## Token Optimization Conversation

Session burned 65k+ tokens. Shirin asked: "Should I switch to Haiku 4.5?"

**Options discussed:**
1. **Switch to Haiku 4.5** - 80% cost reduction, faster, but less capable for complex builds
2. **Hybrid approach** - Haiku for routine/heartbeats, Sonnet for complex architecture
3. **Use Mistral more** - We literally just built this for preprocessing
4. **Shorter sessions** - Start fresh with `/new` more often

**My recommendation:** Try Haiku 4.5, monitor quality. If complex tasks struggle, go hybrid. Medium-term: prove Mistral optimization works, shift most preprocessing local.

**Next session:** Shirin starting fresh to clear context and save tokens. This is the right move.

## Key Learnings

1. **Token awareness matters** - 65k in one session adds up. Need to be more efficient.
2. **Memory discipline is critical** - Write everything down immediately. Can't rely on session context.
3. **Self-review system has merit** - But needs to fit actual failure modes (timezone, memory loss), not generic team-decision patterns.
4. **Autonomous work is live** - Tonight's heartbeat will trigger first autonomous work session. Morning brief will show results.

Commit this memory before session ends.
