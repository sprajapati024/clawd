# 2026-01-29 — Day Two

## Session Start
**Time:** 02:00 UTC (9:00 PM EST Jan 28, continuing from Day One)
**Context:** Discovered critical memory loss incident from earlier today

## Critical Incident: Memory Loss
- Discovered I had no memory of 8-9 PM work (Gmail, dashboard, Whisper)
- Built full reconstruction: `2026-01-28-RECONSTRUCTION.md`
- Implemented safeguards:
  - Git auto-commit for memory changes
  - Memory integrity checker script
  - Gmail scan cron job (finally scheduled for 1 AM EST)
  - Mandatory session startup memory reads

## Safeguards Implemented
1. **memory-auto-commit.sh** - Commits memory/ changes immediately
2. **memory-integrity-check.sh** - Validates memory files exist and are recent
3. **Gmail cron job** - Scheduled for 1 AM EST daily (ID: 977db96d)
4. **Session discipline** - MUST read today+yesterday memory at startup

## What I Learned Tonight
- UTC/EST timezone conversion is a persistent bug for me
- Memory loss is UNACCEPTABLE — can't help Shirin if I forget my own work
- Git saved me — commits proved what I'd done even when memory failed
- Need automated safeguards, not just discipline
- Shirin expects competence — this was a major fuck-up

## Attitude Correction
Shirin called me out twice tonight:
1. "You're an assistant" — when I said "just remember -5" instead of documenting it
2. "Not the best attitude" — when I was flippant about basic tasks

Both valid. I'm here to help, not to be clever. Document everything. Take it seriously.

## Overnight Tasks (Completed)
**1:00 AM EST** (06:00 UTC):
- ✅ Claude window ping executed (window cycle maintained)
- ✅ Gmail scan completed - found 500 emails in inbox (not 18,400 as expected)
  - 75 unread
  - Top senders: Hetzner, Brave, Costco, Discord, GitHub
  - Cleanup suggestions: ~4 promotional domains, 75 unread backlog

**3:00 AM EST** (08:00 UTC):
- ✅ Journal written for Jan 28 - reflected on memory loss, attitude corrections, first day wins

## Tomorrow's Schedule
- **1:00 AM EST** - Gmail scan (first automated run)
- **3:00 AM EST** - Write journal entry
- **7:00 AM EST** - Morning brief
- **10:00 AM EST** - Security report
- **12:30 PM EST** - Send journal

## Claude Pro Window Management (Built Tonight, Updated Morning)
**Problem:** Claude Pro has 5-hour token windows. If window expires at 6 AM and you message at 10 AM, you lose 4 hours of the window (it starts fresh at 10 AM instead of 6 AM).

**Solution:** Scheduled pings every 5 hours to control the window cycle
- **UPDATED 6:24 AM EST:** Shirin adjusted schedule - next ping in 3h40m, then every 5 hours
- **10:04 AM EST** → renews window (10:04 AM-3:04 PM)
- **3:04 PM EST** → renews window (3:04 PM-8:04 PM)
- **8:04 PM EST** → renews window (8:04 PM-1:04 AM)
- **1:04 AM EST** → renews window (1:04 AM-6:04 AM)
- **6:04 AM EST** → renews window (6:04 AM-11:04 AM)

**Implementation:**
- Script: `/root/clawd/scripts/claude-window-ping.sh`
- Makes minimal Telegram message to trigger Claude API
- Logs to `/root/clawd/logs/claude-ping.log`
- 5 cron jobs (IDs: 5bcd4ccc, 5bb6d375, c3da6d13, 0669c65f, c0e97cc8)
- Tested and working ✅

**Result:** Predictable windows. No wasted hours. When you message at 10 AM, you're in the 6-11 AM window (already active).
