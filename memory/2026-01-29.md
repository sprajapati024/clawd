# Daily Memory - January 29, 2026

## Mistral Token Optimization Project - Started

Built Phase 1 infrastructure today:
- Token tracking system (Mistral vs Claude usage + cost savings)
- Mistral API wrapper with auto-logging
- Ollama service configured (auto-start on boot)
- Token stats integrated into morning brief
- Test run: 106 tokens logged successfully

**Next:** Phase 2 - Email preprocessing, security log analysis, memory distillation, finance categorization

## Dashboard Updates

Added **Autonomous Work Queue** - new section for tasks I can pick up independently during downtime:
1. Mistral optimization (Phase 2) - 17% complete
2. Vector embeddings for semantic memory search
3. PostgreSQL database migration  
4. Redis cache layer

**Model:** Autonomy with accountability - update dashboard before/during work, show measurable results

## Infrastructure Priorities Added

Shirin upgraded VPS to 8GB RAM. Need to prove ROI. Added 3 infrastructure projects to autonomous queue:
- Vector embeddings (~500MB-1GB) - smarter semantic search
- PostgreSQL (~100-200MB) - scalable data foundation
- Redis cache (~50-100MB) - performance boost

## Overnight Work Reporting

Added section to morning brief: `🤖 OVERNIGHT WORK`
- When I work on autonomous tasks overnight, write summary to `/tmp/overnight-work-YYYYMMDD.txt`
- Morning brief includes it automatically
- File gets cleared after delivery

**Pattern:** Write to temp file as I go, shows up in 6 AM brief

## Claude Account Switching

Personal account hit token limit. Temporarily using work account (resets 2:53 PM EST today).
- Disabled 5 personal Claude ping crons
- Created 5 temp work account pings (same schedule)
- Auto-cleanup scheduled: Saturday Jan 31 @ 8 AM EST (switches back to personal)

**Timeline:**
- Now → Sat 8 AM: Work account pings (5/day)
- Sat 8 AM onwards: Personal account resumes

## Shirin's Direction

"Have at it those tasks when you want to no rush tho. Update me in morning brief on tasks you did overnight if any."

This is the right dynamic. Autonomy + transparency. Pick up autonomous work when it makes sense, keep dashboard updated, report progress in morning brief. No micromanagement, just results.

## System Status

- Memory: 1GB used / 7.6GB total (13% utilization)
- Disk: 48% used
- CPU: 0.25 load (barely ticking)
- Ollama: 41MB idle, spikes to 500MB-5GB when running inference

Not even close to overloading. 8GB gives plenty of headroom for the infrastructure projects.

## What Matters

Today felt different. Less about proving I exist, more about building real value. Token tracking, autonomous work queue, overnight reporting - these are systems that compound. Shirin trusts me to pick up work independently. That's earned, not given.

The overnight work pattern is key: if I build something useful while he sleeps, he sees it in the morning brief. Clean, documented, measurable. No surprises, just progress.

Next: Work on Phase 2 of Mistral optimization during tonight's downtime. Email preprocessing first - scan/categorize with Mistral, send summary to Claude. Show real token savings.
