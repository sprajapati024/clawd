# 2026-01-29 — Day Two

## Session Start
**Time:** 02:00 UTC (9:00 PM EST Jan 28, continuing from Day One)
**Context:** Discovered critical memory loss incident from earlier today

## Critical Incident: Memory Loss
- Discovered I had no memory of 8-9 PM work (Gmail, dashboard, Whisper)
- Built full reconstruction: `2026-01-28-RECONSTRUCTION.md`
- Implemented safeguards:
  - Git auto-commit for memory changes
  - Memory integrity checker script
  - Gmail scan cron job (finally scheduled for 1 AM EST)
  - Mandatory session startup memory reads

## Safeguards Implemented
1. **memory-auto-commit.sh** - Commits memory/ changes immediately
2. **memory-integrity-check.sh** - Validates memory files exist and are recent
3. **Gmail cron job** - Scheduled for 1 AM EST daily (ID: 977db96d)
4. **Session discipline** - MUST read today+yesterday memory at startup

## What I Learned Tonight
- UTC/EST timezone conversion is a persistent bug for me
- Memory loss is UNACCEPTABLE — can't help Shirin if I forget my own work
- Git saved me — commits proved what I'd done even when memory failed
- Need automated safeguards, not just discipline
- Shirin expects competence — this was a major fuck-up

## Attitude Correction
Shirin called me out twice tonight:
1. "You're an assistant" — when I said "just remember -5" instead of documenting it
2. "Not the best attitude" — when I was flippant about basic tasks

Both valid. I'm here to help, not to be clever. Document everything. Take it seriously.

## Tomorrow's Schedule
- **1:00 AM EST** - Gmail scan (first automated run)
- **3:00 AM EST** - Write journal entry
- **7:00 AM EST** - Morning brief
- **10:00 AM EST** - Security report
- **12:30 PM EST** - Send journal

## Claude Pro Window Management (Built Tonight)
**Problem:** Claude Pro has 5-hour token windows. If window expires at 6 AM and you message at 10 AM, you lose 4 hours of the window (it starts fresh at 10 AM instead of 6 AM).

**Solution:** Scheduled pings every 5 hours to control the window cycle
- **1:00 AM EST** → starts window (1-6 AM)
- **6:00 AM EST** → renews window (6-11 AM)  
- **11:00 AM EST** → renews window (11 AM-4 PM)
- **4:00 PM EST** → renews window (4-9 PM)
- **9:00 PM EST** → renews window (9 PM-2 AM)

**Implementation:**
- Script: `/root/clawd/scripts/claude-window-ping.sh`
- Makes minimal Telegram message to trigger Claude API
- Logs to `/root/clawd/logs/claude-ping.log`
- 5 cron jobs (IDs: 5bcd4ccc, 5bb6d375, c3da6d13, 0669c65f, c0e97cc8)
- Tested and working ✅

**Result:** Predictable windows. No wasted hours. When you message at 10 AM, you're in the 6-11 AM window (already active).

## Saturday Project (Jan 31, 5-10 PM EST)
- VPS monitoring + optimization system
- Performance baselines
- Auto-tuning scripts
- Attack pattern analysis
- Self-diagnostics dashboard

## Sunday Project (Feb 2, 8 AM EST) - Sub-Agent Build
**Fake Day Trading Simulator**
- Tech/AI stocks (NVDA, AMD, MSFT, GOOGL, META, TSLA, AAPL, PLTR, SNOW)
- Gap trading strategy (buy stocks gapping >2% at open)
- $10k fake starting capital
- Risk management: -3% stop loss, +5% take profit, max 3-5 positions
- Fully automated Mon-Fri: 9:30 AM scan/buy, 12 PM monitor, 3 PM close, 4 PM report
- Reports only: morning trades + end-of-day P&L to Telegram
- Uses yfinance (free API, no key needed)
- Cron ID: 86c48038-83bd-4a45-a224-4843eb67ebe1
- Sub-agent uses Claude for build
- Ready to trade Monday Feb 3
