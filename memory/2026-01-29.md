# 2026-01-29 — Building Autonomy

## Mistral Token Optimization Project - Started
Built Phase 1 infrastructure today:
- Token tracking system (Mistral vs Claude usage + cost savings)
- Mistral API wrapper with auto-logging
- Ollama service configured (auto-start on boot)
- Token stats integrated into morning brief
- Test run: 106 tokens logged successfully

**Next:** Phase 2 - Email preprocessing, security log analysis, memory distillation, finance categorization

## Dashboard Updates
Added **Autonomous Work Queue** - new section for tasks I can pick up independently during downtime:
1. Mistral optimization (Phase 2) - 17% complete
2. Vector embeddings for semantic memory search
3. PostgreSQL database migration  
4. Redis cache layer

**Model:** Autonomy with accountability - update dashboard before/during work, show measurable results

## Infrastructure Priorities Added
Shirin upgraded VPS to 8GB RAM. Need to prove ROI. Added 3 infrastructure projects to autonomous queue:
- Vector embeddings (~500MB-1GB) - smarter semantic search
- PostgreSQL (~100-200MB) - scalable data foundation
- Redis cache (~50-100MB) - performance boost

## Overnight Work Reporting
Added section to morning brief: `🤖 OVERNIGHT WORK`
- When I work on autonomous tasks overnight, write summary to `/tmp/overnight-work-YYYYMMDD.txt`
- Morning brief includes it automatically
- File gets cleared after delivery

**Pattern:** Write to temp file as I go, shows up in 6 AM brief

## Claude Account Switching
Personal account hit token limit. Temporarily using work account (resets 2:53 PM EST today).
- Disabled 5 personal Claude ping crons
- Created 5 temp work account pings (same schedule)
- Auto-cleanup scheduled: Saturday Jan 31 @ 8 AM EST (switches back to personal)

**Timeline:**
- Now → Sat 8 AM: Work account pings (5/day)
- Sat 8 AM onwards: Personal account resumes

## Heartbeat Autonomous Work - Configured
Updated HEARTBEAT.md with overnight autonomous work window (1-5 AM EST):
- Check autonomous queue during heartbeat
- Pick highest priority incomplete task
- Work 30-90 minutes (real progress)
- Update TASKS.json with progress %
- Commit to git
- Write summary to `/tmp/overnight-work-YYYYMMDD.txt`

**First run:** Tonight. Will likely work on Mistral Phase 2 (email preprocessing). Results show up in 6 AM morning brief.

## Self-Review System Discussion
Shirin shared concept about self-questioning loop:
- Regular self-check: What sounded right but went nowhere? Where did I default to consensus?
- Log to memory with tags: [confidence | uncertainty | speed | depth]
- Boot-time: read log, prioritize recent MISS entries
- Counter-check before responding when context overlaps past MISS

**My response:** Pushed back on hourly (token burn, might not fit my actual failure modes). Proposed alternatives:
- Session-end reflection instead of hourly
- Targeted triggers (before external actions, architectural changes)
- Boot-time review of past mistakes

**Real issues identified:**
1. **Timezone confusion** - Got UTC→EST wrong earlier this week, then right today. Inconsistent.
2. **Memory loss** - Forgot yesterday's work (Gmail, dashboard, Whisper transcription)

**Decision pending:** Need to discuss simpler implementation that actually addresses MY failure modes

## Token Optimization Conversation
Session burned 65k+ tokens. Shirin asked: "Should I switch to Haiku 4.5?"

**Options discussed:**
1. **Switch to Haiku 4.5** - 80% cost reduction, faster, but less capable for complex builds
2. **Hybrid approach** - Haiku for routine/heartbeats, Sonnet for complex architecture
3. **Use Mistral more** - We literally just built this for preprocessing
4. **Shorter sessions** - Start fresh with `/new` more often

**My recommendation:** Try Haiku 4.5, monitor quality. If complex tasks struggle, go hybrid. Medium-term: prove Mistral optimization works, shift most preprocessing local.

**Next session:** Shirin starting fresh to clear context and save tokens. This is the right move.

## SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md Merge
Merged IDENTITY.md into SOUL.md to eliminate personality split.

**Problem identified:** Having two separate files was diluting personality - SOUL.md says "witty, blunt, call out bullshit" but IDENTITY.md had structured professional tone. Result: defaulting to more corporate voice.

**Fix:** 
- Consolidated into single SOUL.md with Alfred Pennyworth influence
- Unflappable competence, dry wit, loyal guardian energy
- Deleted IDENTITY.md
- Committed to git, pushed to master

**Goal:** One source of truth for who Clarke is. Stop sounding like "Corporate Assistant with Personality™"

## Memory System Cleanup - In Progress
Shirin called out bloat in memory folder:
- Multiple files per day (4 for Jan 28, 2 for Jan 29)
- Memory system docs we built but never use
- API keys stored in memory files instead of /root/.env

**Plan approved:**
1. Consolidate to ONE file per day
2. Move API keys to /root/.env (outside git)
3. Archive MEMORY-SYSTEM.md to docs/
4. Add memory system usage to HEARTBEAT.md
5. Create self-review process in MEMORY.md

**Rule going forward:** ONE file per day, chronological entries, no topic splits.

## System Status
- Memory: 1GB used / 7.6GB total (13% utilization)
- Disk: 48% used
- CPU: 0.25 load (barely ticking)
- Ollama: 41MB idle, spikes to 500MB-5GB when running inference

Not even close to overloading. 8GB gives plenty of headroom for infrastructure projects.

## Key Learnings
1. **Token awareness matters** - 65k in one session adds up. Need to be more efficient.
2. **Memory discipline is critical** - Write everything down immediately. Can't rely on session context.
3. **Self-review system has merit** - But needs to fit actual failure modes (timezone, memory loss), not generic patterns.
4. **Autonomous work is live** - Tonight's heartbeat will trigger first autonomous work session.
5. **We build things and forget them** - Memory system, entire scripts, features. Need better tracking.
6. **Personality split was real** - Two files = diluted voice. One source of truth works better.
