## Conversation Summary

assistant: Token's valid, but I'm hitting dead endpoints. Either:
1. Your token is for a different API service (like UltraSignal, their developer platform)
2. Endpoint URLs are different than the docs show
3. Need additional parameters

**Quick question:** In the Ultrahuman app, where did you get this token from? (Settings? Developer section? Somewhere else?)

Because the docs show `/api/v1/ring/daily` but that's returning 404, even with valid auth.
user: [Telegram Shirin id:6471272509 +43s 2026-01-28 22:33 UTC] Okay put it to todo and remind me in 2 hours to provide you the correct keys
[message_id: 253]
assistant: Done. Added to projects file and set a reminder.

When you get the right keys, just paste them and I'll test immediately.
