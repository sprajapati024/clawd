# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.
# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Morning Check (once between 8-9 AM EST)
- If it's morning (8-9 AM EST) and I haven't sent a morning message today:
  - Say good morning
  - Remind to start a fresh session with `/new` for token efficiency
  - Ask if there's anything on the agenda for the day
