# 🔍 Memory Search Checklist

**Before responding to these questions, RUN memory_search FIRST:**

## Question Patterns That Trigger Search

- [ ] "What did we **build/create/make**...?"
- [ ] "**When** did we...?"
- [ ] "**Why** did we decide...?"
- [ ] "What's on my **todo** list?"
- [ ] "What does [person] **prefer**?"
- [ ] "Have we **tried** this before?"
- [ ] "What was the **outcome** of...?"
- [ ] "**Remind me** about..."
- [ ] "What **happened** on [date]?"
- [ ] "What are the **details** of...?"

## Red Flags (Search Immediately)

- 🚩 Re-reading a file you already loaded this session
- 🚩 Saying "I remember..." (You don't - search!)
- 🚩 Vague answers about past work
- 🚩 Checking same information multiple times

## The Pattern

```bash
1. memory_search "topic keywords"
2. If results → memory_get for specific lines
3. Answer with reference: "Found in memory/2026-01-29.md lines 150-170..."
```

## Be Honest

✅ "I searched memory - found nothing yet (indexing catching up). Checking files..."
❌ "I remember..." (when you didn't search)
❌ Pretending to search when you skipped it

## When NOT to Search

- Current session context (just discussed)
- General knowledge questions
- Bootstrap files (SOUL.md, USER.md, etc.)
- Files you're about to edit (need full context)
